## Website Performance Optimization

A website optimization project provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). The task is to optimize a given website so that it reaches a target score at PageSpeed Insights and have frames per second rate 60 fps or higher.

See the finished website:[Frontend-Project-Website-Optimization](https://jj1201.github.io/Frontend-Project-Website-Optimization/dist/)

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html
###### Target
Make index.html reach 90 or higher score for Mobile and Desktop at PageSpeed insights.
###### Optimization
1. Inline style.css, add media query to print.css.
2. async analytics.js and scripts to load google fonts.
3. Compress pizzeria.jpg from 2.4MB to 70KB.
4. Using gulp, minimize the html, css, scripts and images files.

###### After above optimazions, the pageSpeed score is:
- Mobile: 96/100
- Desktop: 97/100

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).
